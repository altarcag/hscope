# hscope
a virtual thin section imaging project aiming to digitalize the mineral thin section collection of Hacettepe Geological Eng.

The main cause of this project was initially to provide a faster and more accessible way to view thin sections, especially for people giving their samples out to the uni's thin section lab but also to provide students an alternative way to practice applied mineralogy-petrography classes without being have to use a microscope at all. This initial cause then evolved into carrying the whole thin section collection into computers because I have an obsession for taking a record of pretty much everything.

I'm working on this student-led project under the consultancy of Dr. Caner Diker from Hacettepe University. 
Special thanks to Eray Mercan, an electronics undergrad at Gebze Technical University. Without his help, I wouldn't be able to done any of this so far.
